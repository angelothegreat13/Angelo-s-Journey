Short for American Standard Code for Information Interexchange.

ASCII is an standard that assigns letters, numbers, and other characters within the 256 slots available in the 8-bit code. 
The ASCII decimal (Dec) number is created from binary, which is the language of all computers.

The ASCII table is divided in 3 different sections. Those are as follow:

1. Non printable, system codes between 0 and 31.

2.Lower ASCII, between 32 and 127. This table originates from the older, American systems, which worked on 7-bit character tables.

3. Higher ASCII, between 128 and 255. This portion is programmable; characters are based on the language of your operating system or program you are using. Foreign letters are also placed in this section.
